# The old job has come to an end. When will the future come?
# I actually know how well my self learning capability is. I went to the book store with Busy today and read of a tutorial book for chemistry contest, and it reminded me of the days I prepared so hard for the competition. Chemistry is a subject I have better mastery of and I still failed it. How am I supposed to expect my future in the CS industry?
# I don't know. I'm just scared. If I fail this time, my life will be fucked up. The step is taken and there is no way back. I don't want a fucked-up life, but I don't know what is to come.
